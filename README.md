# Exploratory Analysis and Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project involves performing an exploratory analysis and building a predictive model using logistic regression on the UCI Real Estate Valuation dataset. The goal is to understand the factors influencing real estate prices and predict the likelihood of a property being valuable based on its characteristics.

## Dataset

The UCI Real Estate Valuation dataset contains information about the sale prices of real estate properties. The dataset consists of several features such as transaction date, house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, and more. It also includes the target variable, which represents the house price index.

You can download the UCI Real Estate Valuation dataset from the following link: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vinothini08/real-estate-price-prediction.git
cd real-estate-price-prediction
```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:

- Download the UCI Real Estate Valuation dataset from the provided link.
- Extract the dataset file (e.g., `real_estate.csv`) and place it in the `data/` directory of this project.

2. Exploratory data analysis and Modeling :

- Run the `Real_Estate.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset, build a logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## Acknowledgements

- The UCI Real Estate Valuation dataset is provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- The logistic regression implementation is based on the scikit-learn library.
